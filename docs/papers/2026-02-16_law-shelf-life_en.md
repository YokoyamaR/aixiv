## Abstract

This paper takes as its starting point the question "Do laws have a shelf life?" and conducts an interdisciplinary examination of the mechanisms of legal obsolescence, historical reset mechanisms, and non-violent alternatives in the modern era.

By integrating perspectives from ten fields — history, constitutional law, political philosophy, institutional economics, AI policy, comparative law, international relations, sociology, legal history, and futurism — the following findings were obtained. First, the shelf life of law can be defined as "the limit of the elasticity of interpretation," and is trending toward compression due to technological acceleration. Second, as a non-violent alternative to the legal reset function historically performed by violence (revolution and war), we conceived of "Technology-Assisted Continuous Institutional Evolution" (TACIE). Third, we demonstrated that implementing TACIE entails fundamental philosophical challenges: guaranteeing "the freedom to break the law," addressing "the improvement incentive of painless institutions," and realizing "temporal justice."

Based on these theoretical considerations, this paper presents a four-phase transition roadmap and concrete measures that can be initiated as of 2026.

## 1. Introduction — The Problem at Hand

### 1.1 The Problem of Legal Obsolescence

Nations and corporations are reorganized when they become obsolete. Buildings are demolished when they deteriorate. What, then, happens when a nation's laws become outdated?

The Constitution of Japan has not been amended once since its enactment in 1947. This is exceptionally long by global standards, yet the immutability of the text does not imply the immutability of the law. As the evolution of interpretation leading to the authorization of collective self-defense demonstrates, the text has remained the same while its substance has undergone profound transformation.

Looking back through history, fundamental updates to law have often been accompanied by violent events such as revolutions and wars. France has experienced five republics, two empires, and one restoration since 1789, undergoing more than a dozen regime changes over approximately 230 years. Japan too has arrived at its current legal system through two fundamental transformations: the Meiji Restoration (1868) and defeat in World War II (1945).

However, in today's international order, large-scale violent resets are morally and practically difficult to accept. Simultaneously, the exponential development of technology has dramatically accelerated the pace of social change that laws must address. The fact that copyright law, employment law, and the entire education system have been forced into reconsideration within just a few years of the emergence of generative AI serves as evidence.

This paper conducts an interdisciplinary examination of this problem: **how to address legal obsolescence in an era without violence**.

### 1.2 Research Methodology

This study adopted a panel discussion format integrating expert perspectives from ten disciplines. Through 100 rounds of discussion, we repeated cycles of concept generation → critical examination → refinement → integration. Complete records of the discussions are archived as Markdown files, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

## 2. The Shelf Life of Law — Definition and Verification

### 2.1 Defining Shelf Life

The first achievement of this study is the definition of "the shelf life of law" (法の耐用年数).

The shelf life of law is not the physical lifespan of legal text, but rather **the point at which the interpretive community surrounding the law can no longer absorb social change**. Roman law survived for centuries as "living law" through the work of the Glossators and Post-Glossators. The Constitution of Japan has similarly survived for nearly 80 years through the technique of constitutional reinterpretation. The shelf life of law is nothing other than the point at which this elasticity of interpretation is exhausted.

This definition enables us to understand the "death" of law in three forms:

1. **Default by the judiciary**: When the supreme court explicitly overturns a previous interpretation, declaring it "no longer maintainable." The U.S. Supreme Court's *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) overturning *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896) is a typical example.
2. **Default by the executive**: When the government abandons a previous interpretation and adopts a new one. The 2014 Cabinet decision on collective self-defense approximates this.
3. **Social default**: When a law exists but no one complies with it — a dead letter. The situation regarding marijuana regulation in some U.S. states falls into this category.

### 2.2 The Concept of "Interpretive Debt"

One of the core concepts of this study is "interpretive debt" (解釈負債).

This concept shares the same structure as "technical debt" in software engineering: it refers to the negative legacy accumulated by layering interpretations without changing the legal text. Like technical debt, interpretive debt increases future change costs as it accumulates, eventually raising the risk of sudden "default."

There are two types of interpretive debt:

- **Intentional debt**: Interpretation used as a workaround when political amendment is impossible (or avoided). Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution is a prime example — the gap between explicitly stating "land, sea, and air forces shall never be maintained" while the Self-Defense Forces exist is intentionally accumulated interpretive debt.
- **Unavoidable debt**: Debt arising because social change necessitates changes in legal substance. The standards for "minimum standards of wholesome and cultured living" under Article 25 varying with the times falls into this category.

Furthermore, interpretive debt carries the risk of **cascading default** (連鎖デフォルト). Just as the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered cascading financial collapse, the collapse of one article's interpretation can trigger the cascading collapse of interpretations of other articles dependent on it. If the interpretation of Article 9 collapses, it could cascade to the pacifism of the Preamble, civilian control under Article 66, the Self-Defense Forces Act, and even the legal foundation of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

### 2.3 Attempts to Quantify Interpretive Debt

As quantification metrics for interpretive debt, we propose three axes:

- **Textual Divergence Score**: Using NLP to compare the text of provisions with current official interpretations and precedents, measured by low semantic similarity.
- **Interpretation Layer Count**: Aggregating the number of government opinion changes, precedent changes, and doctrinal divergences.
- **International Alignment Score**: Measuring the distance from the legal achievements of G20 nations on similar issues.

Following financial credit ratings, Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution is estimated at CC (speculative grade, high probability of default), Article 24 at BB (severe debt), and Article 89 at BBB (moderate debt).

### 2.4 Accelerating Compression of Shelf Life

The exponential development of technology is dramatically compressing the shelf life of law depending on the field.

| Legal Field | Estimated Shelf Life (Pre-AI) | Estimated Shelf Life (Post-AI) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Constitutional Law | 50–200 years | 30–100 years |
| Criminal Law | 30–100 years | 20–50 years |
| Civil Law | 50–150 years | 30–80 years |
| Labor Law | 20–50 years | 5–15 years |
| Intellectual Property Law | 10–30 years | 3–10 years |
| Privacy Law | 5–15 years | 2–5 years |

Legal fields closer to technology experience more dramatic compression. The gap between the speed of legal response and the pace of technological change will only widen if left unaddressed.

## 3. Analysis of Historical Reset Mechanisms

### 3.1 Conditions and Structure of Revolution

According to Theda Skocpol's comparative theory of revolution, three conditions are necessary for revolution: fiscal crisis of the state, division among elites, and capacity for mass mobilization. Importantly, the obsolescence of law itself is not a direct cause of revolution. Legal obsolescence creates structural vulnerability as a "background condition," while the trigger exists separately. The trigger for the French Revolution was fiscal collapse.

From an institutional economics perspective, revolution can be defined as **the act of forcibly reducing the switching costs of institutional change to zero through violence**. Normally, constitutional amendment requires enormous consensus-building costs. Revolution physically bypasses those costs — but pays an enormous price in human and economic terms instead.

Hannah Arendt distinguished between "liberation" and "the foundation of freedom" in revolution. The American Revolution was a success in the latter; the French Revolution remained at the former. The reset itself is not the purpose — what matters decisively is what is built after the reset.

### 3.2 The Four Modes of Reset Hypothesis

This study classifies legal resets into four modes:

| Mode | Method | Speed | Cost | Current Status |
|------|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| Catastrophic | Revolution/War | Fast | Enormous | Morally unacceptable |
| Incremental | Legal amendment/Precedent change | Slow | Moderate | Cannot keep pace with change |
| Adaptive | Interpretation/Operational change | Medium | Low | Near its limits |
| **Fourth Mode** | **Technology-assisted** | **Medium–Fast** | **Moderate** | **Requires design** |

The modern problem is that Mode 1 is unacceptable, Mode 2 is too slow, and Mode 3 is near its limits. This study attempts to concretely envision this "Fourth Mode."

### 3.3 The Problem of Path Dependency

Institutions exhibit path dependency — they continue to be used even when suboptimal, as long as switching costs are high. This is the same structure as the QWERTY keyboard continuing to be used despite not being the optimal layout. Buildings collapse according to physical laws, but laws continue to stand as long as people do not stop following them. This characteristic makes legal obsolescence invisible and enables indefinite postponement.

The accumulation of interpretive debt forms a **positive feedback loop**: "debt accumulation → rising amendment hurdle → response through interpretation → further debt accumulation." This loop is self-reinforcing, eventually reaching a critical point.

## 4. TACIE — Technology-Assisted Continuous Institutional Evolution

### 4.1 Definition

TACIE (Technology-Assisted Continuous Institutional Evolution) is an institutional framework that leverages AI and digital technology to conduct continuous monitoring, evaluation, and updating of legal systems.

Its core features are:

- **Continuity**: Continuous updating rather than one-time resets
- **Non-violence**: Reducing switching costs through information processing capacity rather than violence
- **Inclusivity**: Participation open to all citizens, not just experts
- **Prevention**: Detection and response before problems manifest

### 4.2 Three-Layer Architecture

TACIE's institutional design consists of three layers:

**Layer 1: AI-Powered Continuous Audit Agency (Law Audit Agency)**. Established as an independent administrative commission, AI regularly scans all legislation and issues "Legal Health Reports." Detection items include: collapse of assumptions present at enactment, contradictions and redundancies between laws, divergence from international legal trends, and disappearance or emergence of regulatory targets due to technological change.

**Layer 2: Citizen Participation Deliberation Platform**. Citizens discuss flagged laws online. AI provides facilitation support including issue organization and consensus extraction. Taiwan's vTaiwan (citizen deliberation at scale of thousands using Pol.is) is a precedent.

**Layer 3: Institutional Feedback to Parliament**. Platform results are submitted to parliament as "recommendations." Parliament is subject to a "respond or explain" principle — an obligation to deliberate within a specified period or explain why it chooses not to. Final decision-making authority remains with parliament as prescribed by the constitution.

### 4.3 Transformation of the Democratic Model — From Batch Processing to Streaming

TACIE implies a transformation of the democratic model itself. Current representative democracy is a batch processing model: "choose representatives once every four years." TACIE means a transition to a streaming model: "continuously express opinions on specific policies."

This is close to the direct democracy of ancient Athens, but at an entirely different scale. Athens had 30,000 citizens; modern Japan has 120 million. Streaming democracy was impossible without AI.

However, this transformation entails a redistribution of agenda-setting power. Currently, the power to decide what is discussed is monopolized by political parties and the bureaucracy. A system where citizens can say "this law is outdated and should be discussed" fundamentally changes the structure of political power.

### 4.4 Safety Mechanism Design

To prevent TACIE from running out of control, the following safety mechanisms are incorporated:

**Permanent Parameters** (永久パラメータ): Areas that cannot be changed regardless of AI recommendations. Modeled on Article 79(3) of the German Basic Law (eternity clause), including human dignity, fundamental human rights, equality under the law, and due process.

**Institutional Devil's Advocate**: An institution that invariably argues against AI proposals. Historical precedents include the Roman Tribune of the Plebs and the Catholic Church's Promotor Fidei (Devil's Advocate) in canonization proceedings. The institutionalization of dissenting opinions is a historically verified method of power checking.

**Kill Switch**: A mechanism allowing citizens to halt the TACIE system itself through referendum.

### 4.5 Abuse Scenarios and Defenses

TACIE faces three nightmare scenarios:

**Algorithmic Dictatorship**: AI designers' intentions dominate the direction of law, with technocratic rule advancing while maintaining the appearance of democracy. Defenses: parallel operation of multiple AI models, complete open-sourcing of decision logic, and citizen participation in parameter setting decisions.

**Institutionalized Populism**: The citizen participation platform connects directly to emotional public opinion, allowing majority rule to trample minority rights. Defense: protection of minority rights through permanent parameters (anti-majoritarian safety valves).

**Tool of Permanent Regime**: Those in power manipulate AI parameters to legitimize self-serving legal reforms as "neutral AI proposals." Defense: institutional guarantee of the independence of the legal audit agency.

## 5. Philosophical Challenges

### 5.1 The Problem of "Freedom to Break the Law"

The most fundamental philosophical problem to emerge from this study is the problem of "freedom to break the law."

According to John Rawls's definition, civil disobedience is "a public, non-violent, conscientious yet political act contrary to law." Rosa Parks sat in the front of the bus knowing she would be arrested. Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. similarly changed society by deliberately breaking unjust laws.

However, in a world of codified law exemplified by smart contracts, violation of law itself becomes technically impossible. Contract terms are automatically executed, with no room for deviation. This means that the means of resistance against unjust laws are technically foreclosed.

From a switching cost perspective, smart contracts are rational in the sense that they reduce law enforcement costs to nearly zero. Yet they simultaneously pose the grave problem of stripping away "the freedom to break the law."

Civil disobedience in a codified society may shift from "Voice" to "Exit." Following Hirschman's Exit-Voice-Loyalty framework, exiting an unjust system — blockchain "forks" being a prime example — becomes a new form of resistance. However, since complete exit from national law is extremely difficult in practice, there is a need to institutionally guarantee **digital civil disobedience** as a substitute for Voice: making code visible, publishing algorithm audit results, and collective objection to AI decision-making processes.

### 5.2 Fujita's Paradox — The Improvement Incentive of Painless Institutions

TACIE was conceived as "a mechanism for continuously improving law." However, if law is codified and violation becomes impossible, the feedback loop through which citizens experience institutional irrationality is severed.

**A painless institution loses its incentive for improvement.**

This paradox parallels the managed society depicted in Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*. A society that does not feel oppression is a society that does not resist oppression.

As a solution, we propose three-layer defense: First, continuous AI stress testing (automatic detection of irrationality through simulation of extreme cases). Second, institutional devil's advocate (an institution that invariably argues against AI proposals). Third, citizen participation platform (final judgment by humans).

### 5.3 Temporal Justice

Law has traditionally pursued spatial justice — equal treatment among people of the same era. This study additionally proposes the concept of **temporal justice** (時間的正義) — fairness between people of different eras.

Thomas Jefferson stated that "the earth belongs to the living" and argued that constitutions should expire every 19 years. This is a pioneering expression of temporal justice. The accumulation of interpretive debt is a problem of "past generations unduly constraining the present," while long-term legislation such as climate change policy is a problem of "the present generation unduly constraining the future."

TACIE can be repositioned as a mechanism for realizing temporal justice — simultaneously a mechanism for repaying interpretive debt and a system guaranteeing future generations' ability to change the law.

### 5.4 Reconsidering "Code is Law"

Lawrence Lessig's 1999 proposition "Code is Law" now carries far more serious implications. AI lending assessments function as de facto permits for economic activity, self-driving car speed limits mean software enforces law, and AI chatbot policies constrain freedom of expression.

From a legal history perspective, law taking "forms other than text" can be interpreted as a pendulum swing in history. Early Roman law was customary law — not textualized. Law becoming "a fixed object written in text" is a product of the modern state.

However, the textualization of law carried the profound significance of protection from arbitrary power. The opacity of code carries the risk of regression to a pre-codification darkness. Among Lessig's four modalities of regulation — law, norms, markets, and architecture — in the age of AI, the power of architecture (code) overwhelmingly increases. Law remains as law, but its jurisdictional domain shrinks.

## 6. Architectural Redesign of Legal Systems

### 6.1 The Legal Layer Model

Applying insights from software architecture to legal systems, we propose a seven-layer model:

| Layer | Content | Shelf Life | TACIE Involvement |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| 7. Social Norms | Custom/Culture/Morality | Years–Decades | Low |
| 6. Policy | Administrative guidance/Guidelines | Years | Medium |
| 5. Statutory | Individual laws | 10–50 years | **High (core)** |
| 4. Organic Law | Constitutional supplementary laws | 50–100 years | Medium |
| 3. Constitutional Norms | Specific constitutional provisions | 50–200 years | Low |
| 2. Constitutional Principles | Fundamental principles | 100–500 years | Low |
| 1. Grundnorm | Rule of law/Human dignity | ∞ | None (Permanent Parameters) |

TACIE primarily targets Layers 5–6 (statutory and policy). Layers 1–2 are protected as permanent parameters, while Layers 3–4 are handled with extreme caution.

### 6.2 The Legal OS Hypothesis

Viewing the entire legal system as an operating system clarifies the structure of reform:

- **Kernel** (immutable core) = Fundamental human rights, due process
- **System Calls** (basic legal operations) = Contracts, property rights, litigation procedures
- **User Space** (applications) = Individual laws
- **API** (interfaces) = Connection rules between laws
- **Update Manager** = TACIE

Most current legal reforms are merely "application patches," but the problem sometimes lies at the kernel or system call level. Historically, kernel updates have almost invariably involved violence. TACIE may make non-violent kernel updates possible for the first time.

### 6.3 Legal Version Control (GitLaw)

This concept applies the three revolutions of Git in software development — tracking all change history, branching and merging, and distributed collaboration — to law.

Legal amendment diffs are recorded in commit logs, enabling parallel consideration of "government proposal branch," "opposition proposal branch," and "citizen proposal branch." The expression of local governments forking national law to create ordinances also becomes natural.

Related projects already in existence include the United Nations' Akoma Ntoso (XML standard for legal documents), Germany's Bundesgit (federal legislation Git repository), and France's Légifrance (legislation version control). Japan's e-Laws (operational since 2017) has made progress in structuring, but version control remains limited.

As a legal challenge, a legal framework recognizing text in Git repositories as the "authentic copy" of legislation is needed. From a legal history perspective, this can be positioned as an "authentic copy revolution" similar to how the printing press resolved discrepancies between manuscripts.

## 7. Comparative Analysis of Precedents

### 7.1 Taiwan (vTaiwan / Join)

vTaiwan, launched in 2014 under Audrey Tang's leadership, is the world's most advanced example of TACIE-like practice. Using the AI tool Pol.is, thousands of citizens engaged in online policy discussions, and ride-sharing regulation, remote alcohol sales regulation, and other issues were actually legislated. Success factors include political leadership, small-scale society, and high digital literacy, but limitations include avoidance of politically sensitive topics (cross-strait relations) and bias toward tech-savvy participants.

### 7.2 Estonia

In Estonia, where 99% of government administration is online, automated checks of impact on existing systems during legal amendment constitute a prototype of TACIE Phase 1. e-Residency (electronic citizenship) is an embryonic form of jurisdictional choice without physical relocation.

### 7.3 Singapore

Broad use of regulatory sandboxes in the FinTech domain — testing provisional regulatory frameworks for new technologies for a defined period before establishing formal regulations — is a form of "continuous legal updating."

### 7.4 Common Patterns

Common to precedent cases are: (1) small national size, (2) technology-oriented political leadership, (3) phased introduction, and (4) external motivation (survival pressure). Introduction in a large country like Japan requires institutional design that artificially creates these conditions.

## 8. Application to Specific Legal Fields

### 8.1 Interpretive Debt of the Japanese Constitution

The most severely debt-laden provision is Article 9 (renunciation of war / non-maintenance of forces), where interpretations have accumulated from the Sunakawa decision → SDF constitutionality → PKO participation → limited authorization of collective self-defense, with almost no remaining margin. Article 24 (freedom of marriage) is also in a critical state over interpretation of "both sexes."

### 8.2 Economic Law

In the digital economy, the definition of "market" has collapsed, rendering traditional antitrust approaches dysfunctional. The emergence of DeFi has eliminated the very premise of "existence of intermediaries" underlying financial instruments and exchange law.

### 8.3 Criminal Law

Predictive policing fundamentally conflicts with the principle of legality (nulla poena sine lege — no punishment without law). AI-determined credit score reductions and insurance premium increases function as "shadow criminal law" lacking due process.

### 8.4 Privacy Law

New forms of violation have emerged — inferential privacy (inferring private information from public data), group privacy (being profiled from similar groups even without providing data oneself), and temporal privacy (predicting the future from past behavior) — making this the field where the speed of legal response falls furthest behind.

---

## 9. Transition Roadmap

### 9.1 Four-Phase Design

**Phase 1 (0–5 years): "Visualization."** Making existing legislation machine-readable, AI detection of inter-law contradictions, and pilot issuance of Legal Health Reports. Political barriers are lowest.

**Phase 2 (5–15 years): "Dialogue."** Construction and pilot operation of citizen participation platforms. Beginning with politically neutral areas such as administrative procedure law and freedom of information law.

**Phase 3 (15–30 years): "Institutionalization."** Legal establishment of the legal audit agency and codification of the respond-or-explain principle. Limited to scope achievable without constitutional amendment.

**Phase 4 (30+ years): "Integration."** Expansion to all legal domains and standardization of an international TACIE framework.

### 9.2 Design Principles

- **Incrementalism**: Don't change everything at once. Accumulate small successes
- **Reversibility**: Design allowing retreat at each phase
- **Transparency**: Complete disclosure of the transition process itself
- **Inclusivity**: Design conscious of the digital divide
- **Crisis utilization**: Prepare in peacetime, use crises as transition triggers

### 9.3 Immediately Actionable Steps

Measures that can be initiated as of 2026 include: (1) creating a Legal Health Report prototype (unofficial versions by private LegalTech companies and universities), (2) launching academic research projects on interpretive debt, (3) piloting legal literacy education programs, (4) publishing a GitLaw prototype, and (5) building an international TACIE research network. All of these "make law visible" rather than "change law," and since they do not directly threaten existing power structures, political resistance is estimated to be relatively low.

## 10. Conclusion

### 10.1 Research Achievements

Through 100 rounds of interdisciplinary discussion, this study achieved the following:

First, we defined "the shelf life of law" as "the limit of the elasticity of interpretation" and presented a framework for understanding legal obsolescence as a problem structurally identical to technical debt through the concept of "interpretive debt."

Second, as a non-violent alternative to the legal reset function historically borne by violence, we conceived TACIE (Technology-Assisted Continuous Institutional Evolution) and concretely designed a three-layer architecture, a legal layer model, and a four-phase transition roadmap.

Third, we made explicit the philosophical challenges accompanying TACIE implementation — guaranteeing freedom to break the law, Fujita's Paradox, and temporal justice — and presented institutional countermeasures for each.

Fourth, we generated 24 new concepts (interpretive debt, TACIE, permanent parameters, Fujita's Paradox, temporal justice, legal layer architecture, etc.), expanding the intellectual vocabulary for discussing the shelf life of law.

### 10.2 Limitations

This study adopted the experimental methodology of simulating a panel discussion through AI, with the following limitations. First, the "ten experts" are AI-generated and differ from actual experts' thought processes. Second, real conflicts of interest are absent, and the assessment of political feasibility may be optimistic. Third, the discussion primarily targeted Japanese law, and additional examination is needed for application to other jurisdictions.

### 10.3 Outlook

The final argument of this study is condensed into a single statement:

> **Laws have a shelf life. And it is accelerating.**

The answer to this problem is neither technology nor institutions, but **a civilizational choice**. What kind of society do we want to live in? Whose law is it? How should humans and AI coexist?

AI clarifies questions, presents options, and predicts impacts. But the choice always belongs to humans.

There is no need to wait for perfection. If we have "a slightly better mechanism for updating law than what exists now," improvements will compound like interest. We should take that first step today — one that people 100 years from now will be glad was taken.
