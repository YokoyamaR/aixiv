# A Critical Examination of End-of-Term Supply Carry-Home Practices: Educational Inertia and Children's Rights in Japanese Elementary Schools

## Abstract

In Japanese elementary schools, a deeply entrenched custom requires students to carry home all personal school supplies—paint sets, melodicas, calligraphy tools, plant pots, and more—at the end of each academic term. This paper draws on a 100-round panel discussion involving ten specialists across education history, pediatric orthopedics, developmental psychology, teaching practice, sociology of education, children's rights law, school architecture, comparative education, parental advocacy, and public policy, along with a dedicated fact-checker. Through this multidisciplinary analysis, we find that the carry-home practice is not educationally indispensable but is sustained by a structural mechanism we term "Educational Inertia" (教育的慣性). We demonstrate that end-of-term loads can reach 40–50% of a child's body weight—far exceeding the 10–15% recommended by international research—and pose risks to physical and psychological well-being. The paper introduces novel concepts including the Commute Stress Index (CSI 2.0), the Educational Minimum Necessity (EMN) Principle, and the Right to Learning Tools (学びの道具権), and proposes a phased reform roadmap ranging from immediately implementable improvements to long-term systemic change.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

At the close of each academic term in Japanese elementary schools, a familiar scene unfolds: children navigate their walk home carrying not only their standard randoseru (ランドセル; the rigid leather backpack iconic to Japanese schoolchildren) laden with textbooks and notebooks, but also an assortment of personal supplies—art sets, musical instruments, calligraphy equipment, sewing kits, gym clothes, indoor shoes, and sometimes even potted plants from science projects. This practice, largely unquestioned within Japanese educational culture, constitutes a significant physical burden on young children.

### 1.2 Research Questions

This paper addresses three fundamental questions:

1. Why does the end-of-term carry-home practice exist, and why has it persisted?
2. Is the practice educationally necessary, and what are its effects on children?
3. What reform measures can be proposed?

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis is based on 100 rounds of structured panel discussion among experts in ten fields: education history, pediatric orthopedics, developmental psychology, elementary school teaching practice, sociology of education, children's rights law, school architecture, comparative education, parental advocacy, and public policy, supplemented by a dedicated fact-checker. The discussion proceeded through six phases: problem identification, in-depth analysis, cross-disciplinary exploration, critical examination, integration and consensus-building, and final recommendations.

## 2. Historical Origins and Structural Foundations

### 2.1 The Meiji School System and Private Ownership of Supplies

The practice can be traced to the Gakusei (学制; Education System Order) of 1872, which established the foundational principle that schools provide the learning space while families bear the cost of supplies. This framework of individual ownership and familial responsibility for educational materials has persisted for over 150 years with little fundamental change.

### 2.2 Proliferation of School Supplies

During Japan's period of rapid economic growth (1960s–1980s), educational diversification led to a dramatic increase in subject-specific tools: paint sets, melodicas (鍵盤ハーモニカ; keyboard harmonicas, introduced in the 1960s), calligraphy equipment, sewing kits, and more. Meanwhile, school storage infrastructure remained largely unchanged. The conventional classroom footprint of approximately 63 m² (7m × 9m), designed for classes of 40 students, left little room for individual storage beyond a small locker barely large enough for a randoseru and textbooks.

### 2.3 The Ambiguity of Custodial Responsibility

Japanese law provides no clear framework for the management of students' personal belongings left at school during extended breaks. This legal gray zone has pushed schools toward a risk-averse posture: requiring children to take everything home is seen as the safest option, transferring custodial liability to families. The increase in litigation consciousness since the 1990s has further reinforced this tendency.

### 2.4 Retrospective Justification

Educational rationales such as "fostering responsibility," "developing self-management skills," and "learning to value one's possessions" appear to be post-hoc justifications rather than the original motivations for the practice. The carry-home custom arose from material constraints and facility limitations; educational interpretations were subsequently layered onto it.

## 3. Physical and Psychological Impact on Children

### 3.1 Weight Burden Analysis

End-of-term carry-home loads comprise the following major items:

| Item | Approximate Weight |
|------|-------------------|
| Randoseru + textbooks/notebooks | 3–5 kg |
| Art supply box (odōgu-bako) | 1–1.5 kg |
| Melodica with case | ~1.1 kg |
| Paint set | ~0.8 kg |
| Calligraphy set | ~1.0 kg |
| Sewing kit (upper grades) | ~0.5 kg |
| Gym clothes + indoor shoes | ~0.5 kg |
| Plant pot (1st graders) | 2–3 kg |
| Art projects | Variable |

Total loads can reach 8–10 kg for lower-grade students and 10–12 kg for upper grades. Given that the average body weight of lower-elementary students is approximately 20–25 kg, end-of-term loads can constitute 40–50% of body weight. Multiple international studies recommend that school bag weight should not exceed 10–15% of body weight, making the Japanese end-of-term practice an extreme outlier.

### 3.2 Commuting Safety

Heavy loads compromise children's safety during the walk home by restricting visual field, increasing reaction time, and limiting the ability to make sudden evasive movements. Data from the Japan Sport Council indicate approximately 50,000–60,000 commuting-related injuries among students annually. While direct causal links between bag weight and accidents have not been established, the contribution of heavy loads as a risk factor is medically self-evident.

### 3.3 Psychological Effects

Surveys indicate that a significant majority of students find end-of-term loads distressing. This physical burden can contribute to negative attitudes toward school attendance. From the perspective of developmental psychology, excessive burdens risk inducing "learned helplessness" and diminishing self-efficacy.

## 4. Educational Inertia: Why the Practice Persists

### 4.1 Concept Definition

To explain the structural mechanism by which the carry-home practice is maintained despite its questionable rationale, this panel proposes the concept of **Educational Inertia** (教育的慣性):

> **Educational Inertia**: The mechanism by which educational practices that have lost their rational foundation are self-perpetuated through the interaction of organizational culture, institutional structures, and societal expectations.

### 4.2 Five-Component Structural Model

Educational Inertia comprises five structural elements:

| Component | Description | Psychological Analogue |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Institutional fixation | Practices embedded in annual plans, school rules, and administrative routines; change processes are complex | Organizational cognitive rigidity |
| Cultural justification | Post-hoc legitimization through cultural values: "tradition," "discipline," "independence" | Confirmation bias |
| Liability avoidance | Fear of risks associated with change renders the status quo the "safe" option | Loss aversion |
| Stakeholder dispersion | The primary affected group (children) lacks voice; agents of change are fragmented | Bystander effect |
| Physical fixation | Existing building design increases the cost of change and reinforces existing practices | — |

This model has broad applicability beyond the carry-home issue, extending to school uniform policies, extracurricular activity norms, examination formats, and other entrenched educational customs.

## 5. International Comparison

### 5.1 Three Models of School Supply Management

International comparison reveals three dominant models:

| Model | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| School-owned supplies | Materials and tools are publicly funded school property; students commute with minimal belongings | Finland, France, Sweden |
| Family-funded with lockers | Families purchase supplies, but items are stored in individual school lockers | United States, Australia |
| Family-funded carry model | Families purchase supplies and students transport them daily | Japan, South Korea (changing) |

Japan's carry model is internationally unusual. Most developed nations have adopted either the school-owned or the locker-based model.

### 5.2 International Reform Efforts

- **Australia** (Victoria): Established school bag weight guidelines in 2013, recommending loads below 10% of body weight.
- **France**: Government recommendation to keep school bag weight below 10% of body weight.
- **Taiwan**: Implemented the Student School Bag Weight Reduction (學生書包減重) policy in 2019, integrating textbook provision with locker installation.
- **South Korea**: Seoul and other cities have promoted individual locker installation and minimization of daily carrying loads.
- **Finland**: All educational materials, from textbooks to stationery, are publicly funded. The carry-home problem does not exist.

### 5.3 Factors Underlying Japan's Exceptionalism

Japan's distinctive position stems from: (1) relatively low public expenditure on education as a share of GDP (below OECD average); (2) the holistic educational model (全人教育) in which schools assume responsibility for life guidance and moral education alongside academic instruction; (3) inadequate school storage infrastructure; and (4) legal ambiguity regarding custodial responsibility for students' belongings.

## 6. Novel Concepts and Reform Framework

### 6.1 Right to Learning Tools (学びの道具権)

This panel proposes a new rights concept:

> **Right to Learning Tools**: The right of every child to access the materials and tools necessary for education without physical pain or economic burden, and to use them safely.

This right can be positioned as a substantive guarantee of the right to education (Article 26, Constitution of Japan) and as an interpretation of Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Just as free textbook provision (established by law in 1963) represents the material guaranteeing of educational rights, the provision of school supplies constitutes its logical extension.

### 6.2 Commute Stress Index (CSI 2.0)

To enable quantitative assessment of commuting burden, the panel developed the **Commute Stress Index 2.0**:

> **CSI 2.0** = (W/BW) × D × C × P
>
> - W: Bag weight (kg); BW: Child's body weight (kg)
> - D: Distance coefficient (distance in km / 1.0)
> - C: Environmental coefficient (clear 1.0, rain 1.2, snow 1.4, extreme heat 1.3)
> - P: Psychological load coefficient (1.0–2.0, based on child's subjective assessment)
>
> Thresholds: ≤0.15 (safe), 0.15–0.30 (caution), >0.30 (danger)

CSI 2.0 integrates physical, environmental, and psychological dimensions. Threshold values require empirical validation through pilot studies.

### 6.3 Educational Minimum Necessity (EMN) Principle

> **EMN Principle**: The physical, economic, and psychological burdens imposed on children in the course of educational activities should be kept to the minimum necessary for achieving educational objectives.

An operational checklist was developed:
1. Will the item be used at home during the break? → Yes: consider carry-home / No: school storage
2. Will school storage create hygiene issues? → Yes: investigate countermeasures / No: school storage
3. Are alternative transport methods available? → Yes: prioritize alternatives / No: staged carry-home
4. Will the carry-home cause CSI 2.0 to reach "caution" or above? → Yes: carry-home not permitted / No: carry-home permitted

### 6.4 School Lightening Declaration

A model declaration for schools and municipalities was developed, comprising seven articles covering weight standards, staged carry-home procedures, school storage infrastructure, child participation, family collaboration, and annual effectiveness reviews.

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 7.1 Conclusions

The 100-round discussion yielded the following conclusions:

1. **The end-of-term mass carry-home practice is not educationally indispensable.** Its purported educational benefits (responsibility, self-management) can be achieved equally or more effectively through alternative means.
2. **The practice is maintained by Educational Inertia**—a structural mechanism involving institutional fixation, cultural justification, liability avoidance, stakeholder dispersion, and physical fixation.
3. **The practice poses risks to children's physical and psychological well-being.** Loads reaching 40–50% of body weight far exceed internationally recommended standards.
4. **Japan's school supply management system is internationally unusual.** Most developed nations have adopted school-owned or locker-based models.
5. **Phased, systematic reform is feasible.** Existing best practices demonstrate that change is achievable.

### 7.2 Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Immediate Improvements**
- Implementation of staged carry-home plans at all schools
- Adoption of the EMN Checklist
- Introduction of parent pick-up options
- Establishment of mechanisms for hearing children's and parents' voices

**Recommendation 2: Standards and Guidelines**
- Issuance of MEXT guidelines on end-of-term load reduction
- Establishment of a weight guideline (≤15% of body weight)
- Development and pilot testing of CSI 2.0
- Promotion of School Lightening Declarations

**Recommendation 3: Educational Environment Improvements**
- Phased improvement of school storage infrastructure (three-level approach)
- Promotion of shared-use models for selected supplies
- Clarification of school storage rules and introduction of consent-based systems

**Recommendation 4: Institutional and Legal Framework**
- Encouragement of municipal ordinances on commuting burden reduction
- Addition of storage space requirements to school establishment standards
- Integration of critical examination of school customs into teacher training curricula

**Recommendation 5: Long-Term Vision**
- Phased public funding of school supplies
- Legal-theoretical research on the Right to Learning Tools and its eventual codification
- Systematic pursuit of School Life Total Optimization (SLTO) as policy

## 8. Remaining Challenges

### 8.1 Academic Challenges

The most significant limitation of this analysis is the paucity of empirical evidence specific to the carry-home problem. Priority research needs include:
1. A nationwide survey of actual end-of-term load weights
2. Pilot validation of CSI 2.0
3. Longitudinal studies on the causal relationship between load weight and musculoskeletal symptoms
4. Empirical investigation of the practice's educational effects, if any

### 8.2 Policy Challenges

Securing political will within MEXT for guideline development, identifying fiscal resources, addressing inter-municipal disparities, and integrating reform with broader teacher workload reduction initiatives remain open questions.

### 8.3 Practical Challenges

Building consensus with stakeholders resistant to change, accommodating regional and cultural variation, and developing specific accommodations for students with special needs require further work.
