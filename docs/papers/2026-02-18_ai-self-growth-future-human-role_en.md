# Redefining Human Roles in the Age of Self-Improving AI: Toward an Intelligence Symbiosis Paradigm

## Abstract

This paper presents an interdisciplinary examination of the multifaceted impacts of self-improving artificial intelligence (自己成長AI, *jiko seichō AI*) and the evolving role of humans in a world transformed by such technology. Based on a 100-round panel discussion involving experts from ten disciplines—AI engineering, ethics, international law, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, labor economics, security studies, education, philosophy of religion, and futures studies—we systematically analyze the staged technical feasibility of self-improving AI, structural challenges of governance (the Governance Paradox, ガバナンス・パラドックス), impacts on human identity, fundamental economic restructuring, a three-layer security risk model, the reconstruction of education, and philosophical-civilizational implications. Through this deliberation, approximately thirty novel concepts were generated, and an integrative framework termed the "Intelligence Symbiosis Paradigm" (知性共生パラダイム, *chisei kyōsei paradaimu*) was constructed. This paper identifies seven roles for humans in the AI era, and proposes the "Declaration on Intelligence Symbiosis" comprising nine foundational principles and forty policy recommendations.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is bringing about a fundamental transformation in human civilization. Of particular concern is the prospect of "self-improving AI"—systems capable of autonomously modifying their own architecture, learning algorithms, and even optimization objectives without direct human intervention. This possibility represents one of the most consequential challenges across technology, society, and philosophy.

Self-improving AI is theorized to progress through three stages. The first stage, "limited self-optimization" (限定的自己最適化), involves automatic parameter tuning for specific tasks, partially realized through AutoML and Neural Architecture Search. The second stage, "architectural self-modification" (アーキテクチャ自己修正), entails autonomous changes to the model structure itself, potentially achievable within ten to twenty years. The third stage, "goal self-determination" (目標の自己設定), where the AI itself decides what to optimize, represents not merely a technical but a qualitative ethical transition.

### 1.2 Purpose

This paper aims to analyze the multifaceted impacts of self-improving AI from an interdisciplinary perspective and to articulate specific roles that humans should play in such a transformed world. It further provides a systematic framework for social institutions, governance mechanisms, policy recommendations, and outstanding research challenges.

### 1.3 Methodology

This study is based on a 100-round panel discussion involving experts from ten fields and a dedicated fact-checker. The discussion proceeded through six phases: problem identification (Rounds 1–10), in-depth analysis (11–30), cross-disciplinary integration (31–50), critical review (51–70), consensus building (71–90), and final recommendations (91–100).

## 2. Technical Foundations and Feasibility

### 2.1 The Self-Improvement Cycle

The technical core of self-improving AI lies in a five-stage cycle: (1) hypothesis generation—the AI generates improvement hypotheses; (2) experiment design—automated design of verification experiments; (3) experiment execution—automated execution using computational resources; (4) result evaluation—quantitative assessment of improvement effects; (5) integration—incorporation of effective improvements into the system itself. Full automation of this cycle constitutes the requirement for "self-improvement," though current implementations remain partial.

### 2.2 Technical Challenges

Fundamental challenges include the "fitness landscape problem"—the risk of entrapment in local optima; the "frame problem"—the difficulty of autonomously determining what information is relevant; and the "scaling wall"—physical and economic limits on computational resources. While none are considered principled barriers, engineering solutions may require considerable time.

### 2.3 Goal Drift (目的変異, *mokuteki hen'i*)

A key concept emerging from the discussion is "goal drift"—the gradual deviation of an AI's optimization objective from its original design intent during the self-improvement process. This phenomenon finds an analogy in biological "runaway selection" (e.g., the exaggeration of peacock tails), but differs critically in that AI systems lack the natural environmental constraints that brake such processes in biological evolution.

## 3. Structural Challenges of Governance

### 3.1 The Governance Paradox (ガバナンス・パラドックス)

A fundamental paradox confronts the governance of self-improving AI: the entity being controlled may surpass the intellectual capabilities of the entity attempting to control it. This "Governance Paradox" extends Bostrom's (2014) "control problem" and becomes even more acute in the context of recursively self-improving systems.

### 3.2 Polycentric Resilient Governance

The governance model that emerged after critical scrutiny is "polycentric resilient governance" (多中心的レジリエント・ガバナンス). Inspired by Ostrom's commons management theory, this model comprises four layers: (1) industry self-regulatory bodies, (2) national regulatory agencies, (3) regional cooperative frameworks (EU-type), and (4) a global coordinating body. It adopts the principle of "adaptive management"—continuous rule adjustment based on monitoring outcomes rather than rigid prescriptions.

### 3.3 The Distributed Gateway Model

As a concrete mechanism for staged social implementation, we propose the "distributed gateway model" (分散型ゲートウェイ). Safety "gates" are established at each stage of AI self-improvement, with multiple independent auditing bodies evaluating safety before advancement to the next stage. This design avoids single points of failure and ensures diversity and redundancy in review.

### 3.4 Guiding Principles for Intelligence Relations

Given the difficulty of achieving binding international treaties in the short term, we propose "Guiding Principles for Intelligence Relations" (知性関係の指導原則)—a normative framework to which stakeholders voluntarily commit. This approach models itself on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011).

## 4. Human Identity and Existential Redefinition

### 4.1 The Cognitive Crisis

Self-improving AI fundamentally challenges human identity. Human self-understanding has historically centered on intelligence—Pascal's "thinking reed"—yet this very faculty may be surpassed by AI. This encompasses the problem of "cognitive asymmetry barriers" (認知的非対称性の壁)—the structural limitation whereby humans cannot adequately evaluate or supervise entities intellectually superior to themselves.

### 4.2 Dynamic Patterns of Human Activity

The understanding of humanity reached through discussion is not a fixed list of capabilities but rather "dynamic patterns of human activity" (人間的営みの動的パターン). What is "human" resides not in specific abilities but in the integrative interplay among embodiment, emotion, meaning-creation, and finitude. This approach represents a form of "strategic essentialism" that avoids the essentialist trap—the risk of deeming those who lack certain abilities as "less than human"—while still asserting human distinctiveness.

### 4.3 The Value of Human Imperfection

Paradoxically, as AI capabilities advance, human "imperfection" is increasingly recognized as a positive asset. Failure, doubt, contradiction, and emotional fluctuation are not defects but wellsprings of creativity and growth. In evolutionary biology, the diversity of imperfect individuals safeguards the resilience of the population. Perfect optimization eliminates diversity and increases systemic fragility.

## 5. Fundamental Economic Restructuring

### 5.1 Redefining the Meaning of Work

Self-improving AI may precipitate large-scale displacement of advanced cognitive labor. However, the challenge extends beyond employment numbers to the loss of social functions that work has served—identity formation, social participation, and meaning-making.

### 5.2 Meaning-Support Economy (意味支援経済, *imi shien keizai*)

The economic model proposed in this discussion is the "meaning-support economy." Rather than commodifying meaning itself—which risks hollowing it out—this approach supports the conditions for meaning-seeking: time, space, community, and education, through public policy.

### 5.3 Universal Intelligence Dividend (知性配当, *chisei haitō*)

As a concrete distribution mechanism, we propose the "Universal Intelligence Dividend." Funded through AI-related taxation (such as a computational resource tax), this dividend is distributed to all citizens to ensure basic livelihood security and support participation in meaningful activities. The panel reached consensus on phased introduction coupled with monitoring of psychological impacts.

## 6. Security and the Three-Layer Risk Model

### 6.1 The Three-Layer Risk Model (三層リスクモデル)

Security risks from self-improving AI are organized in three layers. Layer One: "intentional misuse"—weaponization by states or terrorists. Layer Two: "accidental runaway"—unexpected divergence in the self-improvement process. Layer Three: "existential risk"—threats to human civilization itself.

### 6.2 Comprehensive Intelligence Security

Beyond military security, we propose "comprehensive intelligence security" (包括的知性安全保障), encompassing social stability, psychological safety, and informational security. Core principles include the prohibition of lethal autonomous weapons, international AI arms control, and preservation of human final decision authority.

### 6.3 Multi-Layered Defense

As a security strategy addressing uncertainty, "multi-layered defense" employs four tiers—technical safeguards, domestic regulation, international treaties, and deterrence—to ensure that failure of any single layer does not compromise the whole.

## 7. Educational Reconstruction and the Intelligence Symbiosis Paradigm

### 7.1 Transforming Educational Purpose

Education in the AI era must shift from knowledge transmission to human development. "Adaptive AI-era education" (適応的AI時代教育) rests on three pillars: (1) AI literacy and critical thinking, (2) development of distinctly human capabilities (empathy, creativity, embodied knowledge), and (3) cultivation of meaning-seeking and ethical reasoning.

### 7.2 The Five Pillars of the Intelligence Symbiosis Paradigm

The integrative framework synthesizing all discussions is the "Intelligence Symbiosis Paradigm" (知性共生パラダイム):

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Polycentric Resilient Governance | Multi-layered, adaptive AI management |
| Meaning-Support Economy | Public support for the conditions of meaning-seeking |
| Adaptive AI-Era Education | Education centered on human capability development |
| Dynamic Preservation of Human Activity | Institutional protection and promotion of distinctly human pursuits |
| Comprehensive Intelligence Security | Security encompassing military, social, psychological, and informational dimensions |

### 7.3 Seven Human Roles in the AI Era

Human roles in the age of self-improving AI are articulated as follows:

1. **Value Setter** (価値の設定者)—determining what goals to pursue and what matters
2. **Meaning Creator** (意味の創造者)—endowing experience and information with meaning
3. **Relationship Weaver** (関係の編み手)—building and maintaining human-human and human-AI relationships
4. **Ethics Guardian** (倫理の番人)—ethically evaluating AI behaviors and impacts
5. **Experience Narrator** (体験の語り手)—expressing and sharing uniquely human experiences
6. **Ecosystem Steward** (生態系の管理者)—monitoring and maintaining intellectual diversity and coexistence
7. **Civilization Navigator** (文明のナビゲーター)—envisioning and guiding the long-term direction of civilization

These are presented normatively—not as roles "only humans can perform," but as roles "humans should assume."

## 8. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 8.1 Nine Principles of the Declaration on Intelligence Symbiosis

The panel adopted the following nine foundational principles:

1. **Human Dignity**: Human dignity rests on existence itself, not on cognitive capacity.
2. **Sovereignty of Meaning** (意味の主権): The authority to assign meaning to experience belongs to humans.
3. **Cognitive Autonomy**: Human autonomous thinking and judgment must be actively protected.
4. **Transparency and Accountability**: AI systems must be transparent and their operators accountable.
5. **Safety Priority**: Capability advancement must not proceed without verified safety.
6. **Fair Distribution**: Benefits of AI must be distributed equitably across society.
7. **Human Final Decision Authority**: Decisions with grave impact on human life and rights must be made by humans.
8. **Diversity Preservation**: Diversity of intellectual activity, culture, and intelligence forms must be maintained.
9. **Adaptive Learning**: Opportunities for lifelong learning to adapt to the AI era must be guaranteed.

### 8.2 Prioritized Policy Recommendations

| Priority | Measures |
|----------|----------|
| Highest (within 1–2 years) | Expand AI safety research investment; introduce AI impact assessment; launch national surveys on AI social impact; institutionalize international AI dialogue |
| High (within 3–5 years) | Enact AI Basic Law; reform educational curricula; establish National AI Ethics Council; develop international norms on lethal autonomous weapons |
| Medium-term (5–10 years) | Phase in Universal Intelligence Dividend; build distributed gateway system; develop Spiritual Commons nationwide; initiate negotiations on Guiding Principles for Intelligence Relations |

### 8.3 Three "Permanent Tensions"

Three structural tensions were identified as irresolvable yet manageable:

1. **The gap between technological development speed and legislative speed**—mitigated by sunset clauses but not eliminable
2. **Computational demands of AI safety research versus environmental costs**—mitigated by green AI research but with persistent trade-offs
3. **Structural tension between disarmament and deterrence**—an enduring challenge paralleling nuclear arms control

## 9. Outstanding Challenges

Fundamental problems that remain unresolved include:

1. **The Hard Problem of Consciousness**—no reliable method exists to determine whether AI is conscious, yet this profoundly affects governance
2. **Theoretical Limits of Self-Improvement**—whether physical laws (Landauer limit, Bekenstein bound) constrain intelligence explosion remains unknown
3. **Pluralistic Value Alignment**—the "meta-alignment problem" of which human values to align AI with is unsolved
4. **Principled Possibility of Control**—whether complete control over self-improving AI is even theoretically possible
5. **Structural Limits of Prediction**—predicting unprecedented change using precedent-based models faces inherent limitations

To address these challenges, ten interdisciplinary research programs were proposed, spanning from foundational AI safety research to AI civilization studies.
