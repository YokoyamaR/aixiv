# SPINE-AI: The Future of Spinal Cord Injury Treatment Through AI Evolution — Toward an Integrated Therapeutic Paradigm

## Abstract

This study presents the results of a 100-round panel discussion involving experts from ten disciplines—rehabilitation medicine, neural regeneration engineering, brain-machine interface (BMI) engineering, AI-driven drug discovery, robotics, medical ethics, health economics, clinical psychology, data science, and patient advocacy—alongside a dedicated fact-checker, examining how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can transform spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment. The discussion culminated in the proposal of SPINE-AI (Spinal Cord Injury: Personalized, Inclusive, Neuro-restorative, Ethical AI), an integrated therapeutic model. SPINE-AI is a comprehensive framework centered on the Neuro-Restoration Continuum Adaptive (NRC-A), the Brain AI-Supported Autonomy (BASA) system, and Pragmatic Digital Models (PDM), incorporating a phased implementation roadmap spanning from Phase 0 (immediate improvements) through Phase 3 (long-term vision to 2050). The panel reached consensus on three priority initiatives: an AI-powered bladder management device, standardization of AI rehabilitation protocols, and establishment of a national SCI registry. Ten policy recommendations and eight fundamental principles were formulated.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Current State and Challenges of Spinal Cord Injury

Spinal cord injury (SCI, 脊髄損傷) remains one of the most devastating neurological conditions, with approximately 5,000 new cases occurring annually in Japan alone. Post-injury functional recovery remains severely limited, and SCI has long been characterized as an "incurable disability." Patients face not only loss of motor function but also a constellation of challenges including bladder and bowel dysfunction (排泄障害), neuropathic pain (神経障害性疼痛), thermoregulatory dysfunction, pressure ulcer risk (褥瘡), and profound psychological distress—requiring lifelong medical and caregiving support. The estimated lifetime cost per patient ranges from 100 to 300 million yen (approximately $700,000 to $2 million), representing a substantial socioeconomic burden.

### 1.2 Transformative Potential of AI Technology

The rapid evolution of AI technologies—deep learning, generative AI, reinforcement learning, and multimodal AI—is driving revolutionary change across medicine. In SCI treatment, AI holds promise for accelerating neural regeneration, advancing brain-machine interfaces, streamlining drug discovery, personalizing rehabilitation, and improving prognostic precision.

### 1.3 Study Objectives and Methodology

This study employed a structured panel discussion methodology with 100 rounds of deliberation among ten domain experts, one patient advocate (who is herself living with SCI), and one fact-checker. The objective was to comprehensively examine how AI technology can "rescue" SCI patients and to develop an integrated therapeutic paradigm with a concrete implementation roadmap.

## 2. AI Applications in Spinal Cord Injury Treatment

### 2.1 Neural Regeneration and AI

The four major barriers to post-SCI neural regeneration—axonal growth inhibition, glial scar formation, inflammatory environment, and synaptic reconnection difficulties—require a "multi-target treatment strategy" (多標的治療戦略) that AI is uniquely positioned to design. AI can integrate complex interactions that exceed human analytical capacity, simultaneously determining optimal intervention timing and methods.

In iPS cell-derived neural progenitor transplantation, AI contributes to (1) optimal cell population selection, (2) 3D transplantation site optimization, and (3) post-transplantation engraftment monitoring. Furthermore, protein structure prediction AI systems (exemplified by AlphaFold2) enable atomic-level analysis of nerve growth factor-receptor interactions, facilitating the design of more effective neurotrophic factors.

A significant new insight discussed by the panel concerns the dual nature of glial scars: recent research reveals that scars are not merely barriers but partially support regeneration. AI may enable selective intervention strategies that distinguish between the beneficial and detrimental aspects of glial scarring.

### 2.2 Epidural Electrical Stimulation and the Digital Bridge

The fusion of epidural electrical stimulation (EES, 脊髄硬膜外電気刺激) with AI represents one of the most clinically productive areas in current SCI research. The "digital bridge" developed at EPFL—a system that decodes brain signals via AI and stimulates the spinal cord to restore walking—exemplifies this new therapeutic era.

The panel proposed the concept of "electro-pharmacological therapy" (電気薬理学的治療), wherein AI integrates electrical stimulation with pharmacological interventions. By combining serotonergic and dopaminergic modulators with EES, this approach maximizes activation of the spinal cord's central pattern generators (CPGs).

### 2.3 Brain-Machine Interface and BASA

BMI technology has achieved motor intention decoding accuracies exceeding 90% through deep learning-based decoders. The panel proposed BASA (Brain AI-Supported Autonomy, 脳AI支援自律システム), a concept that repositions AI as a supporter of brain autonomy rather than a replacement. BASA is a dynamic system wherein the brain and AI undergo co-adaptation over time.

A key BASA feature is the patient-adjustable AI intervention gradient—continuously configurable from 0% (full self-control) to 100% (full AI control)—enabling "fading assistance" (フェーディング・アシスタンス) that progressively increases self-control as recovery advances.

### 2.4 AI Drug Discovery and Drug Repurposing

SCI drug development has long suffered from the "translational gap"—efficacy in animal models failing to replicate in humans. While AI drug discovery can help bridge this gap, critical panel examination acknowledged that novel compound development still requires considerable time.

Consequently, the proposal prioritizes Drug Repurposing (既存薬再利用) as the primary strategy. Specific candidates include riluzole (sodium channel blocker), minocycline (anti-inflammatory), and chondroitinase ABC (glial scar degrading enzyme). AI can comprehensively analyze existing drug databases to discover compounds with unexpected neural regeneration-promoting properties.

### 2.5 Robotics and Integrated Mobility Solutions

While powered exoskeletons may evolve from rehabilitation devices to everyday assistive technology through AI control advancement, the panel critically examined the assumption that "walking recovery" should be the primary goal. Patient advocates noted that "wheelchairs are more efficient in many situations," leading to consensus on a paradigm shift toward "mobility freedom maximization" (移動の自由度最大化).

The "Mobility Score" (モビリティスコア) was proposed as a four-dimensional evaluation framework: (1) range of mobility, (2) degree of autonomy, (3) comfort, and (4) flexibility across conditions. AI would recommend optimal combinations of mobility aids tailored to each patient.

## 3. Addressing "Invisible Disabilities"

### 3.1 Autonomic Function Recovery

A recurring emphasis throughout the discussion was the importance of addressing "invisible disabilities" (見えない障害)—bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, thermoregulatory impairment, and autonomic dysreflexia. The patient advocate stated: "You can survive without walking, but bladder problems dominate daily life."

The panel proposed a wearable ultrasound sensor-based AI system for real-time bladder volume monitoring and voiding prediction. Achievable through existing technology combinations, this was designated the top priority in Phase 0 (immediate action).

### 3.2 AI Management of Neuropathic Pain

For the chronic pain experienced by 60–80% of SCI patients, the concept of "Pain Psychology AI" (ペインサイコロジーAI) was proposed—an AI system integrating pain management with psychological state monitoring. This approach combines fMRI-based "pain signature" identification, real-time AI analysis, and neurofeedback training enabling patients to modulate their own pain-related neural activity.

### 3.3 Pressure Ulcer Prevention

AI-based preventive interventions—optimized repositioning, pressure distribution monitoring, and nutritional assessment—were shown through economic analysis to yield substantial cost savings, given that severe pressure ulcer treatment can cost millions of yen.

## 4. The SPINE-AI Framework

### 4.1 Concept and Architecture

Synthesizing 100 rounds of discussion, SPINE-AI (Spinal Cord Injury: Personalized, Inclusive, Neuro-restorative, Ethical AI) is proposed as an integrated treatment model comprising eight foundational pillars:

| Pillar | Key Elements |
|--------|-------------|
| Biological | AI-guided regenerative medicine, electro-pharmacological therapy, PDM |
| Technological | BASA, multi-level interfaces, edge AI |
| Pharmacological | Drug Repurposing priority, individualized drug management |
| Robotics | Mobility Score maximization, AI living support ecosystem |
| Ethical | Dynamic ethics process, AIERB, Life Quality Priority Principle |
| Economic | Phased implementation, outcomes-based payment |
| Psychological | Human-centered support + AI complement, peer research |
| Data | PDM, international data platform, FAIR principles |

### 4.2 NRC-A: Neuro-Restoration Continuum Adaptive

SPINE-AI's treatment paradigm is NRC-A (Neuro-Restoration Continuum Adaptive, 適応的神経回復連続体). Initially proposed as a "planned recovery process," critical review led to its reformulation as an "adaptive support process." The core principles of NRC-A include:

- **Dual axes of recovery and QOL optimization**: Recovery is one goal but not the sole objective. QOL optimization is pursued with equal priority when recovery is limited.
- **Recovery Potential Index (RPI, 回復ポテンシャル指数)**: An AI-calculated index integrating injury level, completeness, age, time since injury, and biomarker values to flexibly guide patients toward recovery-focused or QOL-focused care pathways.
- **Fading Assistance**: Progressive reduction of AI/robotic support as patient recovery advances, promoting autonomy restoration.
- **Life-stage responsiveness**: Treatment plans are dynamically updated to accommodate changing patient needs over time.

### 4.3 Phased Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Period | Objective | Annual Investment |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Phase 0 | 2026–2028 | AI optimization of existing technologies (Quick Wins) | ¥5 billion |
| Phase 1 | 2028–2031 | Establishment and clinical validation of foundational technologies | ¥20 billion |
| Phase 2 | 2031–2036 | Implementation and national deployment of integrated treatment | ¥50 billion |
| Phase 3 | 2036–2050 | Social implementation of advanced technologies | ¥100 billion |

A gatekeeper review is conducted at the completion of each phase, allowing advancement only for initiatives with demonstrated cost-effectiveness.

## 5. Ethical Challenges and Institutional Design

### 5.1 The Eight Fundamental Principles of SPINE-AI

The panel unanimously adopted eight fundamental principles:

1. **Patient Autonomy**: AI supports but never replaces patient and physician decision-making authority.
2. **Adaptive Treatment**: Recovery and QOL optimization are equally important goals; treatment is phased and adaptive.
3. **Equitable Access**: No patient shall be excluded from AI treatment benefits due to economic, geographic, or social barriers.
4. **Ethics-First**: Ethical evaluation shall precede and accompany all stages of technology development.
5. **Economic Sustainability**: Cost-effectiveness shall be rigorously evaluated, with appropriate public funding allocation.
6. **Integrated Psychological Support**: Technical intervention and psychological support shall always be provided in tandem.
7. **Data Rights Protection**: Collection, use, and storage of patient health data shall be conducted transparently under patient control.
8. **Substantive Patient Participation**: Patient voices shall be substantively reflected at all stages of research, development, and policy-making.

### 5.2 Neurorights and Brain Data Protection

Advancing BMI technology demands urgent legal frameworks for "neurorights" (ニューロライツ). The panel proposed five "BMI Ethics Principles": (1) neural data sovereignty, (2) cognitive liberty, (3) mental privacy, (4) psychological integrity, and (5) equitable access. Chile's 2021 constitutional incorporation of neurorights provides a precedent, and similar legislation should be considered in Japan and internationally.

### 5.3 Reconstructing the Concept of Disability

AI technology's advancement transforms the very concept of "disability." The panel affirmed the integration of the "medical model" (repairing bodily dysfunction) and the "social model" (removing social barriers) as its fundamental position. The patient advocate expressed: "I hope AI technology 'expands choices' rather than 'erases disability.'"

A "Five-Dimensional Recovery Evaluation Framework" (5次元回復評価) was proposed to multidimensionally reconstruct the definition of "cure": (1) neurological recovery, (2) functional independence, (3) pain level, (4) psychological well-being, and (5) social participation.

## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 6.1 Conclusion

Through 100 rounds of deliberation, the panel reached the following conclusion:

**"AI holds tremendous potential to help spinal cord injury patients. However, AI alone cannot save them."**

AI is a powerful tool, but its effective utilization requires: evidence-based clinical judgment, ethically guided implementation, institutionally guaranteed economic equity, holistically integrated psychological support, and patient-centered development that amplifies the voices of those who live with SCI.

Rejecting both excessive technological optimism and unwarranted pessimism, the time has come to initiate evidence-based, dignity-centered action toward realizing SPINE-AI.

### 6.2 Ten Policy Recommendations

1. Formulation of a National SCI AI Treatment Strategy
2. Establishment of an AMED SCI-AI Program (¥20 billion annual scale)
3. Legislation mandating a National SCI Registry
4. Regulatory reform for AI medical devices (adaptive regulation)
5. Insurance coverage for AI rehabilitation
6. Initiation of neurorights legislation review
7. Institutionalization of patient participation
8. Enhancement of AI education for healthcare professionals
9. Advancement of international cooperation (GSAIC establishment)
10. Development of an SCI prevention AI strategy

### 6.3 Commitments to Patients

The panel committed to patients that it would: (1) never exaggerate technological possibilities; (2) never forget "today's problems"; (3) listen to every patient's voice; (4) pursue equitable access; and (5) remain honest about failures.

### 7.1 Remaining Points of Contention

Points on which full consensus was not achieved include: (1) the possibility of complete neural regeneration; (2) invasiveness trade-offs in BMI; (3) timing of AI drug discovery breakthroughs; (4) the relative roles of exoskeletons and wheelchairs; (5) regulatory pace; (6) economic sustainability; (7) the appropriate role of AI in psychological support; (8) data centralization versus distribution; and (9) the relationship between "curing" and "accepting."

### 7.2 Unresolved Research Questions

Twenty-seven unresolved research questions were identified, including: (1) methods for safely removing chronic glial scars; (2) precision limits of non-invasive BMI; (3) long-term safety verification methods for AI-designed drugs; (4) the effects of exoskeleton use on neural plasticity; and (5) methods for measuring "living better."

### 7.3 Limitations of SPINE-AI

The proposal's acknowledged limitations include: (1) residual biological uncertainty; (2) uneven technological maturity; (3) the depth of the translational gap; (4) real-world complexity; (5) value pluralism; (6) political and institutional barriers; (7) unpredictability of psychological complexity; (8) finite data; and (9) the inherent limits of "rescue."
